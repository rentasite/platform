October 1, 2008
  - Cleanstate completely rewritten w/ Zen and color.module.
  - Spooner rewritten w/ Zen and color.module
  - Splender rewritten w/ Zen and color.module
  - Simpla rewritten w/ Zen and color.module
  - color_scheme_id_valid now works + will remove old schemes when theme's
    switch.
  - Doxy'd up some more code in color.database.inc and removed superfluous
    arguments.
  - Fixed bugs with color_user and rewritten parts of the color_page_alter()
    scheme ID selection.
  - Cleaned up the doxy where possible. Still trying to work on making code
    clarity #1.
  - Changed color_panel_form to color_settings_form. We had to get that done.
  - #310751 - Fixed PHP 4 compatibility bug with array_combine.
    http://drupal.org/node/310751

  - Updated form_id in color_user_form_alter() to the new scheme settings form
    name.
  - Capitalize first letter of theme in breadcrumb

  New hook_color()
    Essentially we use hook_color to return the information for colorable
    material. In the future this could be used for coloring modules and
    theming stuff.
    - Updated themes to hook_color() format

  - Fixed black BG's on system admin panels w/ example themes. Themes have had
    admin panel background colors moved below DO NOT TOUCH declaration.

  (In progress) New color algorithms API
    When color.module is available there will now be new color processing
    functions available. Currently we have:

  (In progress) New "extensions" tab panel in color schemes settings.

  Issues

  - #315252 fixed jibberish in documentation
  - #314591 fixed localization issues with submit buttons. On color_user too.

  To do:
    - #314568 color_validate()

  On the table:
    - #315813 extended text fields for hexes

  Bugs:
  - If webmaster modifies the reference scheme, generation will mess up. Store
    the reference hex in {color} instead of the reference scheme ID.
  - Examples themes need to have certain CSS case placed below the DO NOT TOUCH
    line.

  To do:
  - (In progress) I want to create a tab in the settings where we can show the
    current available color.module extensions. :)
  - (Completed) Move color.inc to a hook_color() in template.php.
  - (I'm trying, need time!) Module stylesheet manipulation
  - Theme scheme -> Module scheme linking
  - (In progress) Make the functions more seeming to an API, particularly with
    the color changing algorithms.
  - Take out those PHP notices!

September 17, 2008
  (Major commit) Polishing, abstracting, extracting, opening, refining.

  Color.inc changes:
    - 'engine' is now 'replacement methods'
    - 'schemes' is now 'premade schemes'
    - 'fill' in images, the first array element will be the image extension to fill with.
      so far we go 'solid' and 'y-gradient'

  Revamped schema:
    {color} - Stores theme info
      |-----------------------------
      | id  name  type  fields   replacement methods   premade schemes   images   stylesheets ...
      |  default scheme   reference scheme   blend target   preview

    {color_schemes} - Stores scheme info
      |-----------------------------
      | id   name   theme   hex   path   stylesheets   images   screenshot   logo   status

  The idea of keeping an 'extra_attr' and a 'value' to store the lion share of our stuff was getting rather ridiculous.

  Revamped extension system:
    - You can now add your own custom fill methods!
    - Files now being included in color/extend/EXTENSIONTYPE/FILE.inc
      so extend/fill/solid.inc is the solid fill.
    - The function inside the extension that's used is referred as:
      _color_extend_EXTENSIONTYPE_EXTENSIONNAME(). So solid.inc is:
      _color_extend_fill_solid.
    - Also, if you want to use a dash between words in your ext name,
      do so, be sure to use dashes in the color.inc fill arg and the
      extension filename. Inside the function we want undercores.
    - The markup for fills is now:
      array('FILLEXTENSION', x, y, width, height, color1, color2...) (you can list
      unlimited arguments after.

  - User scheme selection has been split into a separate modules
  - Overhauled cache system
  - Overhauled color_set_scheme() and color_get_scheme()
  - Overhauled batch process
  - Overhauled and simplified color_get_scheme and color_get_theme system to use references
  - Refined and simplified color_scheme_form() interface and its CSS
  - New color_get_theme_extras() which only gets called for webmaster's on certain pages to prevent extra queries
  - Nista has been completely remade. It is now 100% based off Zen, prior to this
    it was only in some parts. Additionally, we're using the much refreshened Beta 3 release.
  - Removed unneeded, superfluous functions (such as deprecated color_get_reference())
  - Changed names of buttons on forms, 'Edit' is now 'Modify'.
  - Switched position of darken/lighten on scheme editor

  To do:
    - Open up functions to be more API friendly
    - Rewrite other themes off Zen theme
    - Redoxy this code -- much has changed!
    - Update other variables in code to assure our $scheme and $theme variables are consistent
      throughout the code. (these variables are arrays of key data, in keys)
    - TWEAK!

August 30, 2008
  Gradients and solids are both fills

  - (Clearing ambiguity) 'fill' will now do both gradients and solids. Mention one field if you want a solid color, and 2 field names for a gradient. In accordance with this I have updated the color.inc files on Garland, Minnelli, FriendsElectric and Nista.
  - (Code stuff) color.database.inc functions split up into color.batch.inc (for batch API) and color.generate.inc (for scheme gen).

August 29, 2008
  New preview system

  - (Major feature) Previewing. You can now preview schemes before saving (as if it were a node). No more previews.inc.
    - Removing preview stuff from garland/minnelli.
    - Updated color.js to remove preview junk
  - Added (settings) link to the title of the "Scheme options" fieldset in the color scheme panel.
  - (Setting implementation): status will now work on detecting if scheme is pre-made (0) or admin-made (1)
  - (User interface) added a .description style to example themes. (Things are much easier to see)
  - (User interface) moved 'preview' before 'save'
  - (User interface) 'delete scheme' now 'delete'
  - (User interface) 'cancel' button available in preview mode
  - (User interface) 'make default' now 'set as default'
  - Fixed bug with color.inc snippet scheme names not working
  - Updated friendselectric schemes. Updated CSS for links.

August 28, 2008
  - (Bug fix) only give disabled button + text to schemes with a 'status' of 1 (pre-made) where the setting of 'color_modify_premade_schemes' is off.
  - (Feature) on scheme editing, the theme+scheme will change to the current one you're editing. :)
  - (Under the hood) Major reworking of scheme generation code. color_add_scheme() has now be made into color_generate_scheme_files(), color_set_scheme() now will work with scheme generation.

  Morning
  - (Major rehaul) New scheme creation system. Just click "create scheme" and be on your way.
  - (User experience) Interface changed to fit 'scheme options' inside the square. Consolidating space. :)
  - (Settings implementation) disabling/enabling of modifying pre-made schemes will now work.
  - (Bug fixing) color-edit.css: fixed CSS bug in ie6 and ff3
  - (Polishing) examples/friendselectric/color/color.inc: updated color schemes 'menu-link'
  - (Polishing) examples/friendselectric/color/page.tpl.php: add pngfix class for pngfix support
  - (Clearing ambiguity) color_theme_select_submit() is now color_scheme_select_submit
  - (Clearing ambiguity) color_store_reset() is now color_scheme_reset
  - (Removing deprecated function) color_check_themes(), color_schemes_generated(), color_theme_generated() removed
  - (Feature) Users without theme selection enabled (but with color scheme selection) can choose schemes.
  - (Under the hood) moved variable_set and variable_del to hook_install() and hook_uninstall()
  - (Under the hood) updated hook_uninstall's color_list_colorable_themes
  - (Under the hood) color_list_colorable_themes() updated
  - (Under the hood) updated color.info
  - (Under the hood) Updated color_set_scheme doxy and removed superflous param
  - (Under the hood) Scheme 'status' column changed. 0 is default and 1 is webmaster made.
  - (Documentation) Updated README. It's nice to see I got along to completing some of these ideas. :)
  - (User experience) Updated drupal_set_messages.


  Early hours
  Polishing + bugfixing

  - (Polishing) System settings menu simplefied
  - (Polishing) New icon next to colorable themes
  - (Polishing) Color scheme switching for unregistered users is now officially placed as a demo option.
  - (Polishing) New friendselectric logo
  - (Under the hood) Color system form will refresh theme DB and give show compatibility nonn-enabled themes
  - (Under the hood) /user/{uid}/edit will use cached data
  - (Under the hood) color_list_themes(), which has been moved to color.database.inc is a function which I kind of want to reccomend for core. It gives an extra param to say if you want to return disabled/enabled themes, you can do a NULL for both.

  I will be beginning the D7 port today.

August 26, 2008
  Bugfixing for solo-install on a different LAMP installation.

  - (Fixed) bug where batch was ran twice.

  - (Updated) color.inc examples from 'tag' => '' to 'tag' => TRUE. (makes more sense)
  - 'default_scheme' is now 'default scheme'
  - 'reference_scheme' is now 'reference scheme'
  - 'blend_target' is now 'blend target'

  - 'img' array is now 'image'

August 25, 2008

  - Was able to get the batch API calls back in color.database.inc

  - Color picker will now automatically update suggested colors when a new type is picked.

August 24, 2008
  Midway commit

  - Demonstration theme are being tweaked to look more presentable as colorable themes :)
  - Updated caching to include "Page compression"
  - New feature for theme developers, when scheme editing there will be a textfield where devs can have the color.inc code for a scheme to copy and paste right in! Yay! It was simple to do and helpful :)
  - Updated Nista theme. Updated its schemes. Very nice progress.
  - Updated Spooner, Cleanstate for text-decoration: none on anchors
  - Textarea resized for color.inc viewer
  - Color admin re-factored to conserve space.
  - (Big improvement) Batch API generation and installer
  - (System services) Color.module will only attach after it's activated for a theme, or else it will fall back to the default.
  - Color scheme config panel, admin/settings/schemes
  - More work is being done to slim the system down and make it more modular.

August 21, 2008
  - Fixed bug with color.js and Spooner (a base-only scheme)
  - Updated comments on engine/tag.inc
  - Updated this README a bit!

August 20, 2008
  Most of these updates are fixes for the demonstration and documentation.
  The major exception is the stylesheet engine update.

  - Under the hood: Fixed bug with currenttheme + edit scheme button on color block sending to incorrect theme.
  - Under the hood: Removed superfluous data from edit_scheme form and submit
  - Under the hood: Changed permissions around. Color scheme is now available to those with user_access("administer access control")
  - Under the hood: color_edit_scheme_form() uses $palette instead of $reference to main hue and shift correctly. However, I left a not in the comments to document how $reference and $palette acted with the picker.
  - Under the hood: color_validate() action to the color_get_theme_info section.
  - Under the hood: Put spaces around dot's (.) which concatenate
  - Interface: For intuitive purposes, switching the "select" and "edit" buttons in the color_block_form
  - Demo Theme -- Simpla: removed extra breadcrumb
  - Demo Theme -- Friends Electric: Added default logo
  - Demo Themes -- Fixed font sizes cleanstate and simpla
  - Demo Users: Including a code of theme's color.inc on theme settings pages so viewers can take a look.
  - Documentation. On demo themes: Added comments and spruced up the color.inc on the examples more.
  - Stylesheet changing has been modularized into extensible color replacement engines.
      - engines/shift.inc - for shift themes, with a 'base' color (Garland)
      - engines/tag.inc - for custom CSS replacement
    - In your theme's color.inc, you can use both these engines at once in either order.
    - Developers can also add custom color replacement algorithms by adding their engines which hook in automatically. Create a engines/yourengine.inc with the function _color_engine_yourengine($style, $info, $palette, $options = NULL). Return the modified $style markup. You can input options in theme schemes (color.inc file) by adding 'yourengine' => array(MYVARS/ARRAY/ETC) to the 'engine' settings. Go crazy. :)
    - The color.module DON'T TOUCH statement now separates from all engines/modification as expected. The DON'T TOUCH comment is for CSS markup in your stylesheet's you do not want to have colors modified on.
    - Of course, this means, no more mode-cruft. :)

August 18, 2008 (Firm pencil's down date)
  Last minute touchups + Code documentation + Demonstration themes

  - scheme editor: "Previous Colors" is now color history
  - scheme editor: will now see scheme title. :)
  - scheme editor: will now see breadcrumb including scheme

  * Updated from old 4.7 version (with color support added) -- however this is still bug-prone. There is a width problem in IE7 and button background one in IE6. Just a proof of concept for now. :)

August 8, 2008
  (#132571) to DRUPAL-6--1
  - Webmasters can now rename schemes
  - In theme settings, Edit scheme selectbox will have the default site scheme selected by default.
  - removed stray console.log() in color.js (was preventing farbtastic from attaching)
  - Updated the right branch. Apparently the -dev releases haven't updated for a whole month because I was only committing to the HEAD branch.
  - The "previous colors" (which is our undo function) and suggested colors should be clickable now :)

July 30, 2008
  More leaps

  - (Bug) Fixed gradient preview
  - (Bug) Color locking/hooking functionality.
  - README updated. We have a documentation page over at
  - (Improvement - Work in progress) Color scheme UI overhaul in progress
    - Darken current color
    - Lighten current color
    - Select random color
  - (Improvement - Work in progress) Add/Delete custom, named color schemes from theme configuration page. W/ AJAX
  - (Improvement) - Schemes changed in theme configuration will now update images and values when submitted.
  - (Improvement) Image overhaul
    - Unlimited images
    - Unlimited gradients
    - Unlimited solid-color fills
  - (Improvement) Stylesheet color replacement - We will now offer a Base-shift (garland-type) mode, a Custom mode for just tags, and a Hybrid which is a mix of the two. :) There is an option to automatically pick your mode.
  - (Minor addition) In the Garland color.inc example, I added the "Majestic" scheme. Looks pretty nice.
  - (Correcting ambiguity) In the blocks section, the block will be named 'Pick color scheme'.
  - (Correcting ambiguity) 'Regenerate schemes' button. On the theme config, there will be a new button for this. Previously, you would have to click "Reset to defaults" -- which was confusing and also defaulted other settings.
  - (Correcting ambiguity) table change
    `color_picks` is now `color_users`
  - (Correcting ambiguity) function color_store_theme() to color_add_theme()
  - (Changed name, same function) color_set_scheme() is now color_set_user_scheme()
    Function for setting user schemes selections (Table: `color_picks`)
  - (New function) color_set_scheme()
    Formerly, this was used for storing users' scheme selections. I am now changing this function to the setting of the schemes themselves (Table: `color_users`).

July 23rd, 2008

  Allow BASE only color change! YES
    Notes: If only base color is listed in a scheme, only commas will be listed.
  - Fixed: Fix scheme reset not showing schemes on next pageview
  - Fixed errors for themes without fields 'base', 'text', 'link'
  - Fixed errors for themes without $info['copy']
  - Fixed errors for theme without $info['preview_image'] on preview.inc
  - Updated README.txt

  Color.js
    - is being fixed up for the custom preview.inc setup. The preview.css will change ID's matching your fields inside a div#preview. :)
    - Is being set up to work with instances where certain schemes in a 'base' colorable layout doesn't have the rest/some of the fields setup.
    - I have worked on reattaching the selectbox behavior for webmasters who want to add/remove custom schemes. (Has been driving me crazy!)

July 9, 2008
  Performance tweaks!
  - color_get_schemes(), color_get_theme_info(), color_compatible(), color_get_palette() all use static variables.
  - removed the extra $themes = list_themes(); in _color_rewrite_styleshet()
  - moved code around in color_form_alter() to only retrieve themes and include algorithms when needed. (~40-50ms performance fix)
  - Only taking need columns (id, name, hex) from schemes in color_get_theme_info()
  - fixed support for garland/minnelli screenshot on /user/{uid}/edit
  - fixed admin/build/themes/settings/{theme} to correctly set theme name
  - Cleanstate: fixed up cleanstate a bit.
  - Fixed default variable_get('cache') variables to fit the "Disabled" mode in admin/settings/performance by default.
  - Fixed notice with Undefined indexes by using isset()

  Unfinished:
  - Custom preview.inc option. Currently, if you provide a preview.inc in the theme's /color folder, the default will be overridden.

  Bugs:
  - Without user_access('select different theme')) and select color scheme users can pick schemes w/ block but not user profile.

  - Removed color_legacy function. People will be able to change w/ proper documentation.
  - Fixed bug On scheme change from Garland->Minelli, scheme won't change/update
  - Fixed bug on scheme change to cleanstate scheme shows as aquamarine but "Your scheme does not match with your theme!" shows and color_pick row WHERE uid={uid} won't delete..

  TODO: don't pull misc/file info unless necessary (not on page load alone)
  TODO: Use some static functions to reduce loading the same data twice.
  TODO: On moving to default theme, scheme select will not reset, unless after reload.

June 20, 2008

  - (Fixed) Bug on garland/minnelli with invalid stylesheet recoloring
  - (Tweaked) Suppress repeat warnings in certain parts of scripts.
  - (Updated) Update minnelli color.inc to new version.

  Caching
    I do not see this module as being very cache-friendly. There will have to be some thinking when it comes to this.

  - Block cache: lags on select boxes on anonymous/registered users
  - Caching modes 'normal': interrupts scheme changing for anonymous users. works OK w/ logged in ones

  New color replacement methods!

  Changes:
    - Find and replace fields from color.inc inside stylesheets. /* {{base}} */ #ffffff /* {{/base}} */
    - Include a 'base' field if you want to change colors of non-tagged color values. (I.e. Garland)
    - You can keep the above stylesheets in the /color folder by doing: 'css' => array( 'color/style.css',),
    - Fixed bug w/ blend target storing in DB
    - Added some more logic for falling back to default themes/color theme changing

  Quirks:
    - In listthemes(), must check if theme is enabled in system! This shows extra color-enabled themes in user/{uid}/edit
    - When changing over a theme, the old scheme name may show in selectbox (the module will still correctly move to default scheme for newly selected theme, though)

  We got a color scheme block + anonymous color scheme selection + perms.

  Changes:
  - Fixed up webmaster theme selection
  - Users other the uid 1 can choose scheme.
  - Color scheme changing block. (YES.)
  - Anonymous users can now pick color schemes
  - Started applying user permissions to scheme selection. If user is not granted permission they will not be able to see scheme selection and default to default_set scheme for the theme.

  Need to know: You have to set the 'choose color scheme' permissions for the user type if they want to see the block/change schemes.

  Changes:

  - Legacy support code is now in the color_get_theme_info() function.
  - Updated color.image.inc for some legacy support for gradients without the color field values. (supposed to be listed like x, y, width, height, color1, color2)
  - Modularized code into color.database.inc, color.stylesheet.inc and color.misc.inc
  - Now 3 tables: 'color' for theme info, 'color_schemes' for individual name/theme/hex info, and 'color_picks' for user scheme choices.
  - In color.database.inc, there is now functions to find scheme based on UID, hex, and scheme/theme
  - color_legacy($info) in color.misc.inc function for checking/changing old scheme .inc files to be compatible with this.

  Known quirks:
  - Minnelli is having very odd color effects. (http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/8634/picture8no4.png) (With current color.scheme using legacy support code to fix).

  Users can now pick color schemes

  Changes:
    + Color schemes are now in 'color_schemes' table
    + Instead of every theme having one scheme stored, all schemes are stored for user selection.
    + Scheme file information stored in 'extra_attr' column
    + In preparation for user custom schemes, the 'scheme' column will attempt to match with the 'name' column of a pre-made theme. If no match, in the future will assume it is a custom user theme. (Generate graphics/stylesheet)
    + Users can now pick color schemes for themes on a user basis via user/{uid}/edit. (YES)

  Known Quirks:
   - Color schemes are installed when color.module is installed.
   - New individual color themes are added when you go to admin/build/themes/settings/{theme}
   - When schemes are first installed, esp. after the module installation w/ a few color themes, the set messages list is very long. Need to find a way to quiet that.

  We are on our way to allowing users to select their color schemes.

  Changes:
    - For the moment the inline color scheme selection has been removed from /user/{uid}/edit. Can be placed back at a later time if wanted (it is in 1.6 of color.module)
    - Fixed bug with color schemer showing on none Color.module themes.
    - (Second commit today) Fixed bug where color schemes would change across themes. Every chosen theme w/ a scheme should have it's own row.
    + Users can now store their theme selections (not creations yet) in the DB. It will insert and edit.
    + New special 'user_scheme' name. Currently stores serialized hexed codes for color schemes. Built to support custom schemes for users.
    + A form submit checking for when a theme and color scheme is chosen at the same time.
    + (Second commit today): Used coder.module to brush up a bit.

  This is a commit so my mentors (Konstantin and Dmitri) and anyone else who wants to can see what I've been working on. There is a lot of temporary code in this commit.

  Changes:
  + Inline color scheme select
  + Fixed schemer to work with more themes!
  + Schemer now has some (maybe temporary) support for legacy color.inc files. It will present a warning but still adds to the database all the same.
  + Split functions up into color.image.inc and color.algorithms.inc
  - Removed primary key for indexes atm. For now to change this please Uninstall/Reinstall module. It will suppress some duplicate errors from before.

  Known Quirks: I cannot get the values of the select boxes for color schemes on color-enabled themes to all submit seperately on /user/{uid}/edit. It seems as if the last select box overwrites all the previous ones. And the ['colorselectbox'] hex shows up all around the form output with dprint_r($form);

May 28, 2008
  Changes:
  + Added the "uid" column. Index in scheme for 'theme', 'uid' for the moment.
  + Added "Color-enabled" in description of themes with color support (color.inc files present)
  + Added

  Known quirks:
  - I just found that current color.module in Drupal 6 may not be handling screenshot preview correctly.


May 26, 2008
  Changes:
  + Support for unlimited/custom amount of color fields. Fields atm must be declared in color.inc.
  + Color scheme keys changed to scheme name (was value/hexes). Implemented storage of schemes/other color theme variables in SQL.
  + Color.module install schema.
  + "Reset to defaults" can be used to reset the SQL (incase you wanted to try adding new fields/colors).
  + Gradient colors can now be chosen through field names of your choice.

  Known Quirks:
  - (Fixed) Blank page on module enable/disable, theme change submit/reset. Try reloading the URL w/o form POST.
