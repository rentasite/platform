Readme for Media: Flicker

The Media: Flickr project currently offers Flickr Photoset capabilities to the Embedded Media Field module, available at http://drupal.org/project/emfield. To use it, enable the Embedded Video Field module, and add a Third Party Video field to a content type. For Thumbnails, you'll also need to apply for a Flickr API key, from http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys.

After that, editors will be able to paste a URL or the embed code for a Flickr Photoset or Slideshow into the field, and it will be displayed automatically. Additionally, that URL will be parsed automatically, so the module will know the difference between a Flickr Photoset URL and another supported provider, such as a YouTube video.
